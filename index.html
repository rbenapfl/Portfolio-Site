					<p>Hello, and thank you for visiting my site!  I am a passionate Javascript and Ruby coder looking for my first position as a developer.  I graduated from Dev Bootcamp SF at the end of May 2014, where I learned how to write good code, worked tons of hours programming on a team, and disciplined myself to have the mindset and capability to challenge myself and learn new things at blazing speeds.  Feel free to <a href='mailto:robertbenapfl@gmail.com'>email me</a> (robertbenapfl@gmail.com) If you are interested in adding me to a development team!</p>

						<h2>This Site!</h2>
						<p>This site features useful AngularJS functionality such as painless single page tab switching, and data binding and animations for that home page that you hopefully just watched.  It is a graphical step by step representation of the quicksort algorithm going to work.  Since that algorithm is normally recursive, my job to capture all of the recursive calls working at once was really difficult.  And no it does not have O(n log n) runtime itself or anything close(you can try that and get back to me if you think it's possible, and don't pick the first index to pivot like this picture uses hahaha...). <a href='https://github.com/rbenapfl/Portfolio-Site' target='_blank'>View the Github Repo!</a>

						<h2>Sugarsnap!</h2>
						<p>The flagship final rails project that I coded with three other classmates during the final week and a half at Dev Bootcamp.  We created Sugarsnap, a photo sharing application that will provide users with all photos taken immediately after they are uploaded on the app in their immediate area (great for landmarks, family events, concerts, etc!).  We even finished early and used the Phonegap platform to make it an ios app as well.  Sugarsnap utilizies Amazon s3 and Firebase to make it's functionality possible in a sleek, intuitive, mobile-first design. You can click on the camera to check it out and/or <a href='https://github.com/rbenapfl/Sugarsnap' target='_blank'>View the Github Repo!</a>

						<h2>Rose Colored Comments!</h2>
						<p>Quick and dirty Google Chrome extension I whipped up at a DBC hackathon with one other guy (talk about being a seasoned pair programmer).  We coded a Chrome extension that lets you view youtube comments in a window next to the video player without scrolling down as well as providing a word filtering feature to remove all comments that have a negative flavor.  Neither of us had knowledge about how to code a chrome extension beforehand yet we made one that interacts with the browser window as well as utilizing the Youtube API within a few hours!</p>

					<li><h2>Using this extension</h2><p>You can run this extension by simply <a href='https://github.com/rbenapfl/RoseColoredComments/archive/master.zip'>downloading</a>, unzipping, and going to your extensions in Chrome.  Enable Developer Mode, hit Load Unpacked Extension, and select the Source Folder.  The extension fires up on click so head over to your favorite youtube video and click the extension icon for some positive comment viewing (bonus points if you customize the word filter list to your liking in the JS file).  <a href='https://github.com/rbenapfl/RoseColoredComments' target='_blank'>View the Github Repo </a> and some pictures of it in action!</p>
